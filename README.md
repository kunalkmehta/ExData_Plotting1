This project has been created as course project 1 for Coursera Course "Exploratory Data Analysis".

This repo has 9 files, including this Read Me file. There are 4 png files, showcasing the charts that I created, and then there are 4 R code files, where I have programmed to create these charts and plot the graphs. 

If you want, you can easily run the code to determine the results. Please make sure of the fact that we are assuming that source file will be kept in your working directory. Since it is an extremely large file, with around 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns, therefore it would take around 143MB of space in the memory. To execute the functions our system should have at least 143*2, that is around 300 MB of memory to get the results. The formula for this calculation is: 
Number of Rows * Number of Columns * 8 bytes

It would come out to be 149418648 bytes. Devide it by 1024 and we will get 145916.6484 KBs, and again devide it by 1024 to get 142.496727 MBs

Than you so much for taking your time to evaluate and determine the accuracy of the graphs. 

Regards,
Kunal
